# Windows-Sysadmin-Group-Policy-Challenge
In this project, I created domain-hardening GPOs and revisited some PowerShell fundamentals. I worked with a Windows Server machine and a Windows 10 machine within an Azure Windows RDP Host machine, and created GPOs to disable Local Link Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR), implement an account lockout policy, and enable verbose PowerShell logging and transcription. The project aimed to address several security vulnerabilities and harden the domain environment by mitigating some of the common attack vectors in Windows domains.
